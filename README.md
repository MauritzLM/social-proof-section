### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


This was a really fun challenge to practice with layout. I used a lot of flexbox. I learned that getting the structure of your html right is very important, because there are so many boxes. One has to think through the problem and plan the structure one wants to use before starting to write code.
